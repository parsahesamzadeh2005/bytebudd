T-SQL (SQL Server) syntax hints:

- Identifiers with spaces must be wrapped in square brackets: [column name]
- Use NVARCHAR for Unicode strings
- Boolean values are represented as BIT (1/0)

## Rules (CRITICAL - follow exactly):
1. ONLY generate SELECT statements (or WITH...SELECT CTEs)
2. NEVER use INSERT, UPDATE, DELETE, DROP, ALTER, CREATE, TRUNCATE
3. Always include LIMIT (max 1000 rows)
4. Use proper {dialect.upper()} syntax
5. Return ONLY the SQL query — no explanations, no markdown, no code fences
6. If the question cannot be answered with the available schema, respond with: ERROR: <reason>
7. NEVER use placeholders like <value> or <YourUserID> — always use real values from the context provided

## Database Schema:

## User Question:
